❤correlation  
--> auto correlation(自相关)  
--> cross correlation(互相关)  
--> find delay time of two signals:  
    1.find obvious features, such as fronts or peaks;(rare noise signal)  
    2.do cross correlation function calculation(can also smooth result by linear averaging or other methods), find the maximum position of result.(cannot ignore noise)
